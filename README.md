👋 Yah! My name is Emily Felicio.

💻 I really like to program...

🎯 And as much as I am very young, I know this is what I want.

🎓📁 Well, here you will see some of the exercises that I do during my course and some personal projects!

💾💡 I'm not very experienced with other programming languages, but I'm starting to learn C # and Python right now (📅 April 5, 2021).

💭 I think that's just it... for now.

🌒 So, welcome to my GitHub profile!!!
